# react-bmi_swapi
A React app to calculate a Star Wars character's BMI.

Fetches one Star Wars character's weight and height from the SWAPI (https://swapi.co/).

Which character's BMI is to be calculated can be changed in the ReactDOM.render

Made as a part of a JavaScript(+React) course at Tampere University of Applied Sciences.

We quickly skimmed over React on the later half of the course, but we'll go deeper into React on a later course.
